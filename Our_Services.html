                                <p><h2>Overview</h2> This project provides a detailed analysis of the Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) changes that have occurred in Enugu State Metropolis over a 33-year period (1990–2023). The study captures the dynamic transformations in land use patterns caused by urbanization, population growth, infrastructural development, and environmental factors. By utilizing advanced geospatial techniques and satellite imagery, the research offers a comprehensive understanding of how urban expansion has reshaped the landscape, affecting vegetation, water bodies, and open spaces.

                                    The project focuses on quantifying changes in key LULC categories, such as built-up areas, dense vegetation, bare land, and water, providing critical data for sustainable development. Through this analysis, the study identifies trends such as the significant increase in urban areas and the decline of vegetation cover, emphasizing the need for effective land management strategies. The insights gained from this research are intended to aid urban planners, policymakers, and environmentalists in making informed decisions about land use, conservation, and urban development.
                                    
                                    <br><pr>Furthermore, the project aims to highlight the environmental implications of these changes, including increased flood risks, loss of biodiversity, and potential impacts on climate regulation. The findings serve as a valuable resource for addressing challenges related to rapid urbanization and environmental degradation, while also fostering discussions around sustainable development practices.</pr><br>
                                    
                                    <pr>By integrating LULC maps, statistical analyses, and visualizations, the project provides an engaging and accessible platform for understanding these changes. This research ultimately seeks to contribute to a balanced approach that promotes economic growth while ensuring environmental sustainability and improved quality of life for the residents of Enugu State Metropolis.</p>
